Shower worked but not much pressure. Wi-fi was ok, nothing special. Don't like the mandatory resort fee when i used nothing. Should just be an a-la-carte to use what you want too. But this is the same as all hotels. Should be made as part of the room price and not an addon if its mandatory Did see security riding bikes in parking areas which was nice since its not the best part of town. Walls are very thin. Had some VERY loud neighbors. Bed was comfortable, pillows were standard smooshy ones. Heat/AC unit worked nicely. Room had basic refridgerator, but no freezer. Coffee make with 2 complementary coffees. No microwave, but I had the basic room so there probably would have been in a more expensive room. No lighting on desk or overhead, only wall lamps over bed so hard to work at desk in evenings unless you sit on bed.
