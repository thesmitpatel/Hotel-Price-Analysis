Rooms are clean and nice and big. M 5.9 Passable mc10111010, Jun. 2017 The hotel is a bit old and to me the carpet in the room is very dirty. The concierge (an Asian man) is very unfriendly, when i check in the hotel, i went in first to look for someone to help with the luggage as my husband was outside with the taxi, he just ignore me even thought he is standing right near the entrane door, then every time we ask him for info, his facial expression seems to be very annoying by us. He's in the hotel industry, he should be in a hospitable manner!!
