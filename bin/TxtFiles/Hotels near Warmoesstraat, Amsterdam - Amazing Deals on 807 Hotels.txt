While the 16th and 17th century saw it become popular as a shopping street, it is now referred to as the “Leather area” that runs adjacent to Amsterdam’s famous Red Light District. Visitors who come to Warmoesstraat to explore its historical landmarks will also find a range of restaurants, galleries and quirky shops to explore. In recent times, however, the area has become known for its variety of leather bars, coffee shops and fetish stores, where visitors come to window shop and take a glimpse into Amsterdam’s more controversial aspects. The Prostitution Information Center is a popular attraction that is located on Warmoesstraat, serving as an educational resource for the history behind Amsterdam’s tolerant attitude towards prostitution. The famous Condomerie attraction is also found on Warmoesstraat, the world’s first condom store with colourful window displays and an information centre that provides serious advice on condom use. Less than a ten-minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal Railway Station, Warmoesstraat is in a convenient location easily accessed from the city centre via train, tram, bus or taxi. Running parallel to the river Amstel from the Amsterdam Centraal Railway Station and Dam Square, Warmoesstraat is a long pedestrian-only street that can be explored on foot in less than 30 minutes. Buildings on Warmoesstraat were originally made of wood, and a few of them are still standing strong. It is said that one of the most prominent Dutch poets, Joost van den Vondel sold some of his silk stockings here. Facts about staying in Warmoesstraat What are the best hotels near Warmoesstraat?
