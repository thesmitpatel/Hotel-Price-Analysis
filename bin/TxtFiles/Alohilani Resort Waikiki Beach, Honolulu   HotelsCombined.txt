Once they finish the ongoing renovation, this will be the number 1 hotel in Waikiki! We stayed in a Ocean View level 38, view was breathtaking. Only flaw, you can hear the room next door, walls must be paper thin. I will be back! M 6.5 Okay michelac77, Dec. 2017 Overall this hotel was nice, not all facilities where completed and able to be used. There was noise from 7am which some days was annoying. The room cleanliness was border line to being not good. The bathroom wasn't cleaned properly, some days the benches not even wiped down. In 10 days the sheets only got changed once and some days not enough towels left. My biggest issue when checking in i wasn't advised that they take out of your account 300 USD i had 2 rooms so that was a bit of a blow to the account and didn't get it back into my account until after 7 days id checked out. The location is very good and i think once its all completed it would be stunning, i would give this place another try if back in Hawaii hopefully its only teething issues with the partial finish. N 9.0 Excellent nkw, Aug. 2017 Great location and generally quiet (stayed on the 12th floor). Lifts were slow when called as waterfront side were under renovations. Staff were helpful and efficient. Concierge services was great managing to book iternaries when i left things to the last minute..Thanks Abby! The hotel should look great once renovations have completed and would stay here again. A 9.7 Excellent Anonymous, Aug. 2017 the room was great! very clean. only wish it would've had a bath tub :) i love that the room had a keurig machine, that was awesome! N 9.0 Excellent nancy, Aug. 2017 the newly renovated rooms were great and the hotel location was perfect. we knew beforehand that there was going to be ongoing construction for the renovation, our stay was relatively good. i just wished they finished the renos soon. it seems to be going on for a long time though. Y 9.0 Excellent Yvonne Edwards, Mar. 2017 We love this hotel, particularly for it's location across the road from Waikiki Beach. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations, which means a little inconvenience. We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms this trip, which was just lovely. Look forward to our next visit. L 10.0 Excellent Lucas, Feb. 2017 Hotel is in a great key location and close to all Central locations. At the moment in Feb 2017, the hotel is going under upgrades so it can be a little long on waiting for an elevator but staff are friendly and awesome. A 8.5 Great Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Staff nice and friendly, room was clean. located right next to beach. Elevators are slow, but they are upgrading them so that ok. G 9.7 Excellent Gertrud, Feb. 2017 Pacific Beach Hotel was great. Staff were friendly and helpful. It will be amazing when the renovations are completed and the restaurants and shops on street level are opened.
