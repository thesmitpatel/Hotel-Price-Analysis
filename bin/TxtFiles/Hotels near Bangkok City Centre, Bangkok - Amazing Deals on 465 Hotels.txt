Plants collected from around the globe are on display in Saranrom Palace Park, which was once a royal garden for King Rama V. It offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok City Centre, with picturesque ponds and landscaped flower beds. Dominating the southern end of the park is a marble monument dedicated to Queen Sunantha Kumarirat and Prince Kannaporn Phetcharat, who tragically died during a boat accident.
