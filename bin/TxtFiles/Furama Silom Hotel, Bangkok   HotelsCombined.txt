The breakfast is okay and offers a few choices, but could be better. The room I had was called Superior. The room was very large, but had a small bathroom and a patio with no access. The bed was comfortable. The furniture was old and starting to fall apart. No manual in the room so no information on what services the hotel has to offer??? The only reason I knew there was a pool was because of the photos. The pool area was okay, but looked nothing like the photos. In future, I would stay here again if I need a great location, comfortable bed and okay breakfast. But I would never pay full price.
