It is a constructed archipelago nestled along the Jumeirah coastal region of Dubai. This luxurious resort town is the smallest of the Palm Islands and recognised as the Eighth Wonder of the World. Palm Jumeirah is brimming with spas, boutiques, and high-end restaurants including Mashrabiya Lounge, Frevo, and L’Olivo. The Al Ittihad Park is an exclusive attraction to the area, displaying a dazzling collection of dozens of indigenous trees and flora. The popular Music Hall draws in visitors for evening entertainment and the Dolphin Bay provides for intimate marine experiences. There are also parachuting opportunities and water parks. The exclusive Palm Jumeirah monorail connects the Gateway Station and Atlantis Aquaventure Station, providing easy transit across the island. The Dubai Tram system connects to the Red Line of Dubai Metro at the Marina Dubai Tram Station and Jumeirah Lakes Tower tram system. The Palm Jumeirah endeavour was launched in 2001 by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock/Architects, Inc. In 2007 it was dubbed the world’s biggest man-made island. More than 5,000 families reside in homes along the coastal stretches, making for a higher population density than originally designed.
