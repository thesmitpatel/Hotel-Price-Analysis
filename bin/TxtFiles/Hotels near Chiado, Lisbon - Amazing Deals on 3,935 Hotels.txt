Cultural highlights mesh with reigning art and theatre attractions to offer an unprecedented tourist interest also dominated by modern shopping allures. There is something for everyone in the trendy area of Lisbon’s Chiado Square. The Rua Garrett Street serves as the heart of Chiado Square offering world-class designer boutiques and the famous Café A Brasileira. Art and theatre attractions across the area are highlighted by the opera house Teatro Nacional de Sao Carlos and the Chiado Museum. Modernised tastes are balanced by the historic flavours of baroque churches such as the Igreja de Sao Roque, Igreja do Carmo, and the Sao Roque. The ruins of Igreja do Carmo are an additional notable allure. Chiado square is accessible by public transportation serviced by train at the Rossio Station and multiple bus stops including Largo Trindade Coelho, Chiado, and Rua do Ouro. Walking is the most popular form of transit around the square itself. The commercial boom of Chiado Square was initiated in the 18th and 19th centuries highlighted by the establishment of many museums, cafes, and theatres. The most notable event in the history of the area was the 1988 fire which destroyed more than a dozen buildings and resulted in a massive reconstruction of the square.
