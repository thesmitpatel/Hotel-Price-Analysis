G 8.5 Great gavin cook , Sep. 2017 I've been staying there for 30 yrs T 7.9 Good thomas, Mar. 2017 the score does not reflect the overall experience. I have stay at this hotel 3 times this year. the hotel itself is really good both in facilities and location. Soi 11 is a central hub around Nana. it's the room condition that's the key down. I can only comment on the main building as I haven't as yet stayed in the tower. rooms on the main are quite spacious. very hard creaky single beds everytime. 24' tv wouldn't work. overall the rooms are looking very tired these days. also, the pool is a late opener opener 8am.
