Warm welcome and very friendly reception team. Easy and efficient book in process. Very clean and comfortable room. Bathroom very small and difficult to get to bath/shower without closing the door. Bed and pillows a bit hard but OK for a couple of nights after busy day sight seeing. B 8.7 Great Brenda, Nov. 2017 I had a room overlooking the road so was kept awake by the traffic, even though the double glazing was closed. I think I should have immediately asked for another room overlooking the back. U 7.0 Good Uffe A, Jul. 2017 Very small but clean room. Terrible temperature in the room during warm summer days due to no air condition. Try to get a room facing the garden, because noisy street at other side.
