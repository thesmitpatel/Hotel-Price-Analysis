There are plenty of bookshops, as well as massage parlours if you need some pampering. Feeling peckish? Khao San Road offers everything from traditional Thai to pizza parlours and falafel joints. Come nightfall, the street comes alive with a variety of bars, from hidden pubs to rooftop clubs where you can soak up Bangkok views. Getting around Thanon Khao San Khao San Road is easily accessed by bus and is around 20 minutes by taxi from the Siam or National Stadium BTS stations.
