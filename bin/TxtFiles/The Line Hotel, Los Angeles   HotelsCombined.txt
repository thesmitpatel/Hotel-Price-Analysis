Lots of good energy around the area and plenty of places to eat good Korean food. The only downsides for us were: street noise (itâ€™s not the quietest of locations) mattress (made a strange squeaking noise and got rather hot at night). Choose the view looking towards the HOLLYWOOD sign if you can, but this is more expensive. The service from all staff was excellent.
