Normal check out time in other countries is 12;00 noon. A 8.5 Great Anonymous, Nov. 2018 This was my second stay with Hotel Villa Fontaine and it was as good as the first time. This time we were welcomed with self-check-in instead at the counter which was pretty easy to use. The rooms were small but just enough for the two of us. Love all the amenities in the room especially the shampoo and body wash. The hotel was also conveniently located near Shiodome station and walking distance to Shimbashi, which made it easy for us to travel to Disneyland. Two things that could be improved on could be the strength of wifi connectivity and the channels on the TV as they were limited and mostly in Japanese.
