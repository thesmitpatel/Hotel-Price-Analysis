Breakfast is exceptionally great but less assortment. The staff are so inviting and it took only few minutes to check within. The shuttle runs each 30 minutes and the driver is magnificent. The lavatory was appealing and had a decent shower, an open cabinet conceit with a little sum of storage. We like staying here for the convenience of the airport, plus the transportation to and from the airport.
