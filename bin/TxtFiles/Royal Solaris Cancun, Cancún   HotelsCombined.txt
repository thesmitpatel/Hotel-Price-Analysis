In the dining room waiters were very fast and efficient even though the restaurants are buffet I had waiter service when needed. They were fast and attentive and I would like to specifically mention Angel from the main dining room who helped me settle in the first day and looked after me in following days as I am in a wheelchair. I stayed in two rooms, having moved because the first room did not have a balcony. The move went smoothly because of staff. help. Please be aware that there are few balcony rooms in this hotel before you book. I could not stay two weeks in an enclosed room. The balcony room is much smaller but fine for one or two people, it is worth the trade-off to go to a smaller room with a balcony. The room was very clean and well stocked with towels and amenities but there is no comfortable chair to sit and read or just to sit and have a drink. The lighting is very bad if you wish to read so be prepared to have fun in the lounge instead. They had plenty of variety in the food offerings and also drinks which I tink were not watered down. Wait staff really on the bit, which makes me wonder why I spent so many vacations in the Caribbean where on can hardly catch the eye of wait staff and then never know if they have heard you. Believe me, Mexico is much better in this regard and very modern and equipped with the latest technology, good infrastructure -roads and light, cooling systems,airport all top notch. I met many 'time share' people there who loved the place after 20 or more visits. That says a lot. Reception is very friendly and helpful. The owners and managers are doing a great job in the Royal Solaris. I would trade my time share Viva Wyndham in in a miinute if I had not rreached the age I now enjoy. I love SOLARIS.
