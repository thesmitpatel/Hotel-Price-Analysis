The city of Paris is divided into 20 districts spiralling outwards from Kilometre Zero, which is the exact centre of the city. The 1st district encompasses the Paris City Centre. Famous and historical attractions within the Paris City Centre include the Musée du Louvre, the world’s largest museum and equally historic landmark. The Tuileries Garden is a public area containing monumental sculptures and trees directly beside the Louvre Museum. Other notable attractions within the Paris City Centre are the Les Halles, Palais Royal, Comédie-Française, and Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. The Paris City Centre is served primarily by the Chatelet/Les Halles metro station and the nearby Concorde and Madeleine stations. Walking is the most convenient way of journeying around the area. There is some taxi service, however, the eastern end of the district is not car-accessible. The Paris City Centre and 1st district in totality are surprisingly the least populated of the 20 divisions, but the most visited by tourists. The beating heart of one of Europe’s major cities is an emblem of ancient history and world modernisation. Facts about staying in Paris City Centre What are the best hotels near Paris City Centre?
