Rooms are under some work, but no major renovations. A/Cs are very old and broken, but are not being replaced. Basicly, rooms are being painted, and maybe TVs replaced. No coffee machine. Washrooms are old, worn out, and for the most part not functioning properly. Room cleanliness may seem almost satisfactory, until you look in detail (under bed, behind furniture, behind toilet, etc.) Needs a bigger investment, even though that would drive up price.
