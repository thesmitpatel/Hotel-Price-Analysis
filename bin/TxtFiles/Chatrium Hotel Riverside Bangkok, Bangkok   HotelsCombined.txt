G 9.7 Excellent George, Mar. 2018 In case you should like a first class hotel close to the river at a reasonable price, Chatrium Hotel Riverside , should be your first choice unless you can afford the Peninsula or the Mandarin Oriental. The staff at check-in were efficient and polite, and in spite of the large number of Chinese guests during Chinese New Year, the service was always prompt and first class. The rooms are large and have splendid views of the river. Breakfast was great. The shuttle to Saphan Taksim and the BTS was very convenient. This hotel was a great choice for a stay along the Chao Phraya river. Highly recommended.

A 8.7 Great Anonymous, Dec. 2016 Good hotel, has a good location. Regular boat connection between the skytrain. Room service is on point. Pool opening hours are long. Pillows are very comfy. Downside - elevators malfunctioned, and because of the that queue was very long and the lobby was overcrowded. Wifi did not work properly.
