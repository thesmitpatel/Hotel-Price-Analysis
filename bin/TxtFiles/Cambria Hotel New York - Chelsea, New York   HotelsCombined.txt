Reviews had been good and were not wrong! Although the rooms were small for 4 people, they were clean and provided all of the essentials. What we did find above and beyond was the attentiveness of the staff. We would especially like to thank Melissa, Kenza, Tyler, Joanna and Gerard. They were not only extremely helpful but went out of their way to make us feel at home! Would highly recommend this facility! A 8.3 Great Anonymous, Jan. 2017 The room was a bit small and there was not very much closet space. There was evidence that it could have been cleaned better ( we found debris on the bathroom floor and under the bed, that was not ours. The shower curtain smelled bad and was stained.) The bed was extremely comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful.
