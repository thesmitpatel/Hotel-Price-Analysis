The bathroom was small and the bath itself was dangerous. The toilet was located so close to the bath that you had to sot sideways when using it. The bathroom sink was located outside the bathroom. No closet or place to store your luggage.

A 8.3 Great Anonymous, Jul. 2018 so small room as other hotels in hongkong. but enjoyed a nice view on the highest room. considered the price, I was satisfied:) A 5.0 Passable Anonymous, Jul. 2018 1. Air-conditioning is not cool enough. 2. Bed is 'spring bed', not comfortable with some hard surroundings. 3. I remarked I need double bed, it still gives me 2 single beds, totally ruined my stay as couple.
