Rooms came with so many amenities, we hated to leave.Rooms are very large. B 10.0 Excellent Bill, Oct. 2019 Everything was great. T 9.3 Excellent thefastfurious , Apr. 2019 Truly 5 star experience from the check in to check out. Rooms were sparkling clean, all facilities in room from oven to tea kettle, water bottles everyday to pan and pots (if required). their bathrooms are huge and spa was great, all the amenities were great. Also, the hotel didn’t have any casino (the way we wanted) which means less crowded but you are not far from the strip, only 10mins walk and you are in the middle of all the fun you want. Their staff was friendly and always happy to help, kids friendly and great pool & gym. we loved the hotel and will definitely recommend. T 9.0 Excellent T, May 2018 Way cleaner than an average strip hotel. Shuttle service to and from the hotel to the strip was great and easily makes up for being slightly away from the main part of the strip. Excellent service and greatly exceeded expectations.If you want a casino , smoking, etc. then this is not the hotel for you.
