Great location and very neat and clean rooms. H 4.5 Mediocre hrelia, Nov. 2019 We arrived the line ups were huge to get in. On our last night room was not cleaned , no toiletries, left the concierge 3 messages on the forth time they should up. just awful. When checking out rep asked us and I told them the issue took our phone number and was told a supervisor will call to date no phone call. P 4.0 Mediocre pitman1, Feb. 2019 our room was dirty on arrival (Thursday night)- the only thing that looked like it was done was clean towels and a made bed - the counters were not only dirty but sticky and our sofa was OBVIOUSLY stained with some kind of grossness!! the walls were covered in dirt spots in the bedroom area and bathroom. we called down to complain on the Friday night as our room was NOT EVEN TOUCHED all day and come Saturday - our bed was made and we had towels. They didn't remove any garbage or clean counters or address our 'stain' issue on the soft. With resort fees that we pay I would of loved to have at least house keeping. We will never EVER stay at the Flamingo again. Service was horrible. We left sunday morning HAPPY TO BE GETTING OUT OF THERE!!!
