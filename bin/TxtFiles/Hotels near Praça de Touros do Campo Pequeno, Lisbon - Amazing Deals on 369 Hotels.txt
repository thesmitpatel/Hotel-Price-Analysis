The neo-Moorish, a redbrick arena was extensively renovated in 2006 and today features an underground shopping center, modern cinema, and several Portuguese restaurants. Reflect on the history and culture of Portuguese bullfighting with a visit to the Campo Pequeno Museum, which displays over 120 years of photographs and memorabilia. For a unique experience, see a traditional bullfight featuring eight unarmed “forcados” dressed in 18th-century breeches and a horse-drawn bullfighter equipped with a spear. The arena was designed by Portuguese architect António José Dias da Silva and inspired by the old bullring in Madrid. Taste local cheeses and cured meats on the terrace of Rubro Tapas Bar while marveling the arena’s typical horseshoe-shaped windows and oriental domes at each cardinal point. Getting there The Campo Pequeno Bullring is located in the center of Lisbon opposite Campo Pequeno Metro Station and Entrecampos Railway Station. There’s limited parking available on site.
