SeaWorld Orlando is home to killer whales, bottlenose dolphins, penguins, sea turtles and stingrays. SeaWorld Orlando is easy to navigate, as it is separated into several unique themed areas called “Seas”. The main entrance houses a freshwater marina with a ‘Shamu’ killer whale themed lighthouse. The “Sea of Shallows” hosts most of the park’s animal exhibits. The area, designed to look like Key West is home to Dolphin Theatre and Turtle Trek attractions. It is also the habitat of greater flamingos, American alligators, West Indian manatees and Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. “Sea of Legends” has the floorless roller coaster “Kraken” and the lost city of Atlantis to explore. Visitors looking to chill out can head to “Sea of Ice”. Themed around Antarctica, the “Empire of the Penguin” is its popular main attraction. There are educational penguin exhibits and an exciting themed ride to discover. Those visiting to see the famous Killer Whale shows can do so in the “Sea of Power” stadium next to Wild Arctic pavilion. The latter is particularly exciting for children over the Christmas season when guests can ride the Polar Express to the North Pole to meet Santa. Alternatively, warm up in the zone named “Sea of Delight” which resembles a charming Mediterranean Village. Here, visitors will find the only land animal shows in SeaWorld Orlando. SeaWorld Orlando has several unique dining experiences including Sharks Underwater Grill where visitors can dine while observing sharks at play.
