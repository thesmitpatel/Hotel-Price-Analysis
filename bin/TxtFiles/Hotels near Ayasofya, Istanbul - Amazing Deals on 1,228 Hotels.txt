This domed museum is an iconic cultural and architectural landmark of the Byzantine era. Lavish interior and exterior designs representing entire periods of history attribute to the landmark’s pervasive appeal. Hagia Sophia displays Byzantine architecture with its impressive domed structure, exquisite marble pillars, and encompassing galleries of colourful mosaics. A few of the most illustrious decorations are the Loge of the Empress, Marble Door, and Wishing column. Mural masterpieces artfully cover entire walls of the interior, representing historical religious elements of the formerly utilised church. Hagia Sophia is located 20 kilometres from Istanbul International Airport. Both the metro and light tram route to the respective Sultanahmet Station. The museum is a short walk from the station. The history of Hagia Sophia is rooted in religion dating back to the year 360 when it was first built as a church. The church was reconstructed twice throughout the ages and transformed into a mosque in the 1400s. In 1935 it was finally named a museum in order to serve as a permanent monument to the Byzantine era for visitors in ages to come.
