It’s home to the iconic Venice Boardwalk, where colorful street performers, bikini-clad rollerbladers, and funky vendors create one of the most vibrant scenes in Los Angeles. Soak up the vibrant atmosphere while strolling or cycling along the palm tree-lined boardwalk. Watch skateboarders at the beachfront skatepark, shoot hoops at the outdoor basketball courts and refresh with a juice at Muscle Beach, where Arnold Schwarzenegger once famously bulked up. Sunbathe and swim at the five-kilometer beach where you can take a surfing lesson, play a game of volleyball or join a Venice drum circle. To see a quieter side of Venice life, walk south of Venice Boulevard towards the Venice Pier. Getting there Venice Beach is roughly 30 minutes’ drive from downtown Los Angeles. Take the I-10 and turn right onto Venice Boulevard. Paid parking is available along the waterfront. You can also take the train to Downtown Santa Monica Station and then a bus to Venice Way.
