The iconic theme park gives guests the chance to go beyond the screen and immerse themselves in an exciting line-up of thrill rides, live shows, movie sets and attractions. From Transformers and Jurassic Park to Minions and The Simpsons, it brings everyone’s favourite characters to life. The resort encompasses the theme park itself, as well as Universal CityWalk, the resort’s on-site restaurant and entertainment district. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter has quickly emerged as one of the park’s most popular experiences, with guests flocking to gaze up at Hogwarts Castle, ride the Escape from Gringotts 3D rollercoaster, and sip on butterbeer at the Leaky Cauldron. Universal Studios Florida is just a 20-minute drive from Orlando International Airport, which means guests can start experiencing the excitement as soon as they step off the plane. Today, the resort is made up of two theme parks, which are connected by the magical Hogwarts Express steam train. Universal Studios Florida has been dazzling visitors since 1982 and has undergone several expansions over the decades. Attention to detail is second to none, with the park enlisting film directors to help them bring the experience to life. Steven Spielberg has worked plenty of magic, and served as a creative consultant for rides inspired by E.T, Back to the Future, Twister, Jaws, Men in Black and Transformers.
