I enjoy their hot bath and sauna which is located on the top floor. Sure to revisit again for my next trip to Seoul. J 8.4 Great Jessie, Feb. 2019 Open Hot Bath is unbeatable and the key reason for me to choose this hotel and I will revisit again for my next time. But I will request for a higher floor and better facing since my stay was on 3rd floor and facing the car park, which is not the ideal one.
