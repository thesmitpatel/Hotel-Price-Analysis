I checked 'couple' because that was the most accurate choice, but we are just two friends who like to travel together, and the smallness of the pod was no problem, we had everything we needed, and who needs roominess when you're out and about all day. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location is great- lots of good strolling right in the neighborhood, plus easy access to subway. A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, Dec. 2016 Room is super small and the bed is not good. A 7.6 Good Anonymous, Nov. 2016 The rooms are tiny, clean, bed is very hard.
