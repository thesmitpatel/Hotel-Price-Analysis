It really succeeded my expectations though and I will definitely stay again. The rooms are very big, bathroom has a huge bathtub and there is a huge shopping mall in 5 minutes walking distance. moreover the staff was super friendly and I was able to not only store my luggage until I had to go back to the airport that night but also use the sauna, pool and shower before I left. The hotel itself might not be very modern or fancy but I couldn‚Äôt have asked for more for my 24 hour layover.
