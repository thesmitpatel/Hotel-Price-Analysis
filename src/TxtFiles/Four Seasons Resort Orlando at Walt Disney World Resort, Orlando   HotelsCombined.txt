First of all, why 'at Walt Disney' is written on the name when it is separated to Disneyland? I thought it is within Disney hotels and tickets are included. If I had known I wouldn't have booked it. Second, room service does not suit Four seasons name, the cappuccino was not made correctly it was a water with a flavor of coffee and milk! the soup was too salty I couldn't finish it, and pasta and potatoes seemed reheated not freshly cooked. Housekeeping did not work well, on day 2 I fell a cotton pad in between bed and side table. It still there until I checked out. I put bathrobes on floor to get them replaced but unfortunately they hang them on the closet area. I sent items to laundry,I received them missed then after calling they items not belong to me. I got mine after 3 days and after I claimed many times !!! Not to mention, They gave us a room for disability while we told them that we are on a honeymoon !!! and we had to pay 3000 per stay to change the room because they said nothing is available in same category we booked. Even though, it is not appropriate for couple inter honeymoon to stay in this room !!! Every dollar I spent their was not worthy I didn't enjoy and I believe I wouldn't stay again there.
