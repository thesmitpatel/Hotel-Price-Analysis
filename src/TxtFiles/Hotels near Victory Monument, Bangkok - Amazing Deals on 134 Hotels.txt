The entirety of the monument’s architectural design is fascist, including the central obelisk, which represents five bayonets stuck together. It is encircled by five statues of soldiers symbolising Thailand’s army, navy, air force, police and militia. Located in one of Bangkok’s busiest transportation areas, the Victory Monument has become a popular hangout for Thai locals and visitors. It’s surrounded by budget-friendly Thai eateries and local boutiques, as well as two prominent shopping malls, theatres, karaoke bars and a night market. After you’ve admired the Victory Monument, take a short walk south to Soi Rang Nam for some high-quality Thai cuisine served in shop-house eateries. If you prefer some retail therapy, head to the nearby Center One Shopping Plaza or Victory Mall. Getting there The Victory Monument is best reached by catching the BTS Sukhumvit Line to the Victory Monument station and walking about five minutes.
