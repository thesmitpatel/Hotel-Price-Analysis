Balcony was very small but was nice to sit out there and chill. bathroom was a good size with an open closet w/ shelves to lay you clothes, etc on. Fully equipped kitchen everything you'd ever need. Before I booked this I had read that the front desk at check-in tried to do a sales pitch, but this never happened to us. Pool areas were nice! Each day they had different activities throughout the day that you could participate in, if you'd care to do so. It was nice and quite and could not hear any one through the walls. Only 2 things I'd complain about. The place had a musty smell to it, but you get used to it and its not as noticeable. The bathroom sink detained very slowly and we just dealth with it but reported it when we checked out. I'd stay there again!
