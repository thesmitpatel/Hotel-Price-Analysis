A 3.7 Poor Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Checkin staff not pleasant nor helpful. Room was terrible. Firstly it was very small, it had a bad smell, felt dusty and overly filled with purchasable souvenirs. Toilet was the size of an airplane toilet. Large dogs allowed at premis which barked and hauled at night. At night it had the feel of a brothel with loud ladies and drunkards along the corridor. The only good part of my stay were the friendly and helpful bell boys (Paul) and valet staff.
