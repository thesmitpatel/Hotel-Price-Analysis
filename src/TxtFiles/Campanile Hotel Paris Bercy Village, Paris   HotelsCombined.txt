The check-in staff ridiculed me that it was fun to come to Paris alone. Service of check-in staff was very bad. I do not want to visit again. M 9.5 Excellent Mary, Mar. 2017 Great location near the metro station and not far from Lyon Railway Station. The place is not crowdy and safe. The hotel has great breakfasts, the rooms are clean and comfortable, equipped with a safe. The drawbacks were that our room lacked refrigerator and it was kinda stuffy.
