The zoo hosts a variety of animals, from primates and penguins to amphibians and exotic birdlife, on its 42-acre property. Honolulu Zoo is home to many of the world’s endangered species. Black Rhinos, Sumatran Tigers, Komodo Dragons and Palm Cockatoos can all be viewed at this unique conservation facility. Visitors entering the zoo are instantly greeted by a flourish of pink flamingos in the pond, beautiful gardens with orchids, sculptures and a plethora of wildlife. Animal lovers can spend time at the elephant enclosure before making their way into the African Savanna zone. This wilderness is home to meerkats, giraffes, cheetahs and hippos and is one of the largest ranges inside the zoo. The park has a variety of cafes, snack bars, gift shops and picnic lawns and there’s also a playground for the little ones. As a nod to the zoo’s heritage, a significant piece of land is dedicated to birdlife. Visitors can admire Australasian birds, parrots, hornbills and many more species. Just outside the zoo grounds on Monsarrat Avenue, local artists introduce their work in a natural outdoor setting. The artwork allows visitors to view Hawaii through the eyes of the creatives. When the animal adventure is complete, take a short stroll to Queen’s Surf Beach, as this section of Waikiki Beach is ideal for relaxation and boasts the Waikiki Aquarium located at the eastern end of the shore. Outdoor movies are shown on weekends at sunset. This stretch of beach is also perfect for surfing, bodyboarding and snorkelling. Those staying outside the city can drive to Honolulu Zoo, as there are parking facilities on Kapahulu Avenue. Waikiki Trolley bus operates from Kahala Mall to Diamond Head, and there are buses which run up and down Kalakaua and Monsarrat Avenues close to the zoo entrance. Walking is pleasurable along the beachfront, a stroll from downtown Waikiki to Honolulu Zoo takes approximately 30 minutes. Originally, the land of Honolulu Zoo was marshland. In the year 1877, marshes and lagoons were drained and then used to house the Queen Consort’s collection of exotic birdlife.
