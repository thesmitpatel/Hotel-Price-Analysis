It consists of an outdoor amusement park, an artificial lake and island, plus Adventure, previously the world's largest indoor theme park. This is a major family attraction in South Korea's capital city. Adventure is divided into four floors, each with a concoction of rides and attractions that are mostly aimed towards children. French Revolution is the most famous, a roller coaster that twists 540 degrees while going in and out of the building. The Magic Island area is outside and continues the theme of roller coaster and traditional fairground rides. Within Lotte World visitors can also find South Korea's largest ice skating rink, the Water Park and an aquarium. Jamsil Station on Seoul Subway Line 2 (the circle line) is located directly beneath Lotte World. A variety of city buses also stop outside the theme park. Inclusive passes provide access to the entire complex; these are reduced in price when entering during the evening. As it's mostly indoors, the park is open all-year-round. Lotte World competes with its rivals Disney and Universal Studios by featuring some 40 of its own cartoon characters, including Lotty and Lorry, a pair of loved-up raccoons, and Maurice, a wine-swilling pig.
