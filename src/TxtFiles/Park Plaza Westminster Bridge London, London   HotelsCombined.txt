The room was spacious and clean but I was just able to see a wall from the window. There was no view and no sunshine at all. Breakfast was better than I expected. There were not that many types of foods but most of them were fresh and delicious. The staffs were nice. They actively supported the guests for fast check-in and check-out. I would like to choose the hotel again next time I visit London. Next time, I hope I have a room with a good view. A 9.1 Excellent Anonymous, May 2019 Great location, excellent service and very comfortable room. A 10.0 Excellent Anonymous, Jan. 2019 I picked this hotel because of the proximity to a conference I was attending. I was given a complimentary upgrade upon arrival and my room was spacious, clean, modern and very comfortable. I would love to stay here again. C 9.5 Excellent Chris, Jan. 2019 concierge staff were generally excellent although our first contact in the car park outside the entrance had the concierge ask us in a rather impertinent way if we were in the right location; having just driven 350miles and struggled through London traffic we were looking for some assistance and courtesy and not a judgement on our appearance or the fact that we rolled up in a rented Ford Focus and not a Beemer.
