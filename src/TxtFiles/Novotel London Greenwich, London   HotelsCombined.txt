There was no hot water for a 24 hours but it's not a staff problem and it was solved next day. G 8.4 Great george, Feb. 2018 The hotel is literally next door to the rail/DLR station, giving convenient links to Central London and beyond. It's a few minutes walk to the centre of Greenwich. Our room was large and very clean, with tea and coffee facilities and a safe. There was a wide choice at breakfast. I chose the 'full English' from the hot buffet. The food was very tasty but 'lukewarm' on all four mornings of our stay. We've stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions and haven't encountered this before. All the staff we encountered were efficient and extremely friendly.
