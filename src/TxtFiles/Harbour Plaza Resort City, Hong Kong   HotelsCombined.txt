A 8.4 Great Anonymous, Mar. 2017 It was okay. The furniture are a bit out of style. Just a little better than the minimum I suppose. We didn't realize that there are 2 towers to the same hotel. Apparently tower one is for longer stay but they would also accommodate shorter stays if they have the rooms. We checked in at tower two, which ran out of queen size beds and only had 2x twin size rooms. wondered if they had queen size bed rooms in tower one. They said HotelQuickly didn't book the queen size room for us so we'll just have to make do with what we have. Over all it's a good stay. good location. would come back again.
