The three-kilometre beach comprises several individual sections collectively known as Waikiki Beach. The beach promenade runs along the coastline and offers a collection of tiki bars, beach shops and cafes. Water sports are a given at Waikiki Beach, with opportunities to surf, snorkel, body board or enjoy stand-up paddleboarding, parasailing, canoeing and kiteboarding. The easy waves are ideal for surf lessons, which were once taught by the “father of modern surfing”, Olympic gold medallist Duke Kahanamoku. Stroll to the beach named in his honour, then keep an eye out for the well-known statue of Duke with his surfboard. If you’re travelling with young children, check out the tranquil swimming lagoon at Duke Kahanamoku Beach. Head to the family-friendly Fort DeRussy Beach Park for smaller crowds, a grassy picnic area and beach volleyball nets. Royal Hawaiian Beach offers outrigger canoe rides. Getting there Waikiki Beach lies on the south shore of Honolulu, with a parking garage at Fort DeRussy Beach Park. Taxis depart from major resorts and malls or you can use rideshare services and the Waikiki Trolley. Facts about staying in Waikiki Beach What are the best hotels near Waikiki Beach?
