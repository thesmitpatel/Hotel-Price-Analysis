F&B mgr Jeff and front desk assistant took care of me when an error occurred with the ordering system. also requests can be done through an ipad. con- no space to put water bottle in the fridge, no kettle but there was heaps of services to buy/order a bottle. one small nit picking detail the shower (there was a rain shower and normal shower head) and the normal shower head would wet you when you turn on the water K 7.5 Good kennedy.sue, Oct. 2017 Great location, don't like pets being allowed in a hotel so that was a negative. Yelping dogs in the room across from us, sharing lifts and common areas with animals is not appealing. Don't understand people who want to coup up animals in a hotel room, quite sad. Hotel also needs to be more proactive in promoting it's services.
