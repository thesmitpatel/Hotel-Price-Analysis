The service at check in was easy, the rooms have been improved and they have introduced hospitality guest functions on Tuesday and Friday evenings. The food and drinks were good (and free) but the best part was the welcome by Guest Relations Manager, Robbi. He went out of his way to make sure that our stay in New York was memorable and we will stay in contact with him. The location is easy and cheap to reach by subway from JFK, just around the corner from Times Square and a short walk to the theater district. We can highly recommend this hotel, especially for overseas guests.
