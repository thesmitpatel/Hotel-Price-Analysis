The area is north of the Old City and on the northern side of the river is full of attractions, tourist sights and a vibrant and celebrated nightlife. It is an old and historic district of the city as well as a modern day commercial hub as a location full of tourist attractions and cultural landmarks. Taksim Square is the central feature of Istanbul city centre and is a wide, open and iconic destination, surrounded by bars and restaurants and containing the Monument of the Republic in its centre. In this area, visitors can discover the Atatürk Cultural Centre, the French Institute and Hagia Triada Orthodox Church. Off Taksim Square, visitors can explore the famous pedestrianised street, Istiklal Caddesi, which is always full of people and lined with restaurants, cafes, bars and shops drawing in locals and tourists alike. Other attractions of Istanbul city centre include Galata Tower, an old stronghold in which visitors can climb to the top, the Pera Museum, full of ancient archaeological artefacts and the Museum of Innocence, offering a quirky and original collection. Visitors can travel Istanbul city centre and experience a well-known tourist attraction at the same time by taking an iconic vintage tram on Istiklal Street, or they can simply walk through this pedestrianised part of the city. There is also an underground railway system connecting the district to other areas of the city, and in Taksim Square visitors will find the central metro station connecting with the rest of Istanbul. Istanbul city centre was once a completely separate settlement which rose rapidly on its own as a busy waterfront and built up defences to protect its warehouses with some remains, like the Galata Tower, still visible today. The district became a banking area in the 18th century and then a trade centre in the 20th century with the extension of the port, known for its collection of Greek taverns. Now it is the centre of the city of Istanbul and a reminder of its heritage and story while retaining a unique and local atmosphere.
