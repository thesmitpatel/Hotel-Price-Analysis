Purpose built for amplified music, the hall takes the concept of live entertainment to another level. Over the decades it’s hosted a stellar line-up of international acts. From pop starlets like Rihanna, Beyoncé and Katy Perry to timeless songwriters like Bob Dylan, Afas Live is no stranger to legends. Thanks to its strategic design, the Heineken Music Hall boasts some of the best acoustics on the planet. Over the years it’s received multiple Pollstar Awards nominations for “Best International Music Venue”, and is now a staple on high profile European tours. As well as an incredible sound experience, the Heineken Music Hall is also known for its dazzling light shows and first rate facilities. The Heineken Music Hall sits to the south-east of the Amsterdam city centre, with the 12-kilometre drive taking around 20 minutes. It’s an easy 30-minute train journey from Amsterdam Centraal, stopping at Bijlmer ArenA station. From here, the Heineken Music Hall is steps away. With a capacity of 5500, the atmosphere at the Heineken Music Hall is electric. The party continues long after the curtain has dropped, with the Beat Box night club throwing famously rowdy post-concert dance parties. There are a handful of great bars on-site, pouring cold beers for thirsty fans. Needless to say, Heineken is available on tap.
