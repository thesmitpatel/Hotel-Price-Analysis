The country is a fascinating blend of old and new, with gleaming skyscrapers standing alongside ancient royal temples. Immerse yourself in centuries of history and heritage or get lost in the neon-lit skyscrapers and futuristic shopping malls of Tokyo. Delicious local food is the icing on the cake. Things to do in Japan The Japanese are immensely proud of their local culture and traditions. Travelling around the country, you’ll have the chance to sleep on woven tatami mats at traditional Japanese inns, admire beautiful geishas, stroll around Zen rock gardens and soothe your muscles at bathhouses. From cinematic Mount Fuji to pristine Shiretoko National Park, Japan boasts awe-inspiring scenery. Around 65% of the country is mountainous, making Japan a mecca for skiing and snowboarding. Carve up the slopes at iconic resorts such as Niseko and Hakuba or escape to Sukayu, a postcard-perfect ski town known for its world-class runs and bubbling “onsen” hot springs. Japan is dotted with historic gems such as Himeji Castle, one of the finest examples of Edo architecture in the country. Also known as White Heron Castle, the 17th-century stronghold towers over the town of Himeji. Food is a highlight in Japan, with local delicacies such as unagi eel, deep-fried tempura and soba noodles guaranteed to tantalise your taste buds. On the coast, you’ll be tempted by rainbow-coloured sushi and sashimi made with locally-caught seafood. Wash down your meal with a glass of sake rice wine or a bottle of Asahi Super Dry. Head south and you’ll discover sun-drenched beaches and laid-back coastal towns. On the Izu Peninsula, beaches such as Nagahama, Shirahama and Sotoura will charm you with their soft sand and crystalline water. Getting around Japan A world-class public transport network makes Japan amazingly easy to get around. In Tokyo, the subway is often the fastest and easiest way to travel. Shinkansen bullet trains are a fast and affordable way to cover long distances. In addition to Tokyo International, Japan is also serviced by major airports in Osaka, Tokoname City and Hiroshima.
