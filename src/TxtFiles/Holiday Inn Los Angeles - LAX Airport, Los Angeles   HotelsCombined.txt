Very convenient for someone always on the run. M 5.4 Passable Matthew, Mar. 2019 The room was clean and I canâ€™t fault the cleaning staff. That is where the compliments end. Room has been built on the cheap. the taps run and the bath fills up when you try to have a shower. the website promised a free breakfast which we then didnâ€™t get. Reception staff were disinterested and unfriendly. For the cost, nowhere near meets the required standard.
