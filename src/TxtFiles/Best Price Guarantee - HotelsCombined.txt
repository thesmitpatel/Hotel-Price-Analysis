Should you find your hotel room at a lower online rate after you have booked with a site listed on HotelsCombined, we will refund you the difference, provided that this lower rate is available on a website: Other than those websites available for booking on HotelsCombined, and Other than the official hotel website or any website directly operated by the hotel, accessible from the hotel page on HotelsCombined, via the "official site" link. You must contact us within 24 hours of making your booking to be eligible for the Best Price Guarantee. Conditions apply: The lower rate must be available on the website that is not participating in HotelsCombined comparison process. You must book your room with the best priced booking provider having used HotelsCombined. As hotel prices can change frequently, you must contact us within 24 hours of purchasing your hotel room from the lowest priced booking provider using HotelsCombined. Please include the following information: your name, reservation number, copy of the confirmation e-mail/voucher and the website where the lower rate is available. The guarantee is not applicable for same day bookings. The guarantee only applies in respect of a lower rate that is available for online booking. The lower online rate must be bookable when we validate your claim, within the 24 hour period. The lower rate must be found online for an equivalent room at the same hotel as booked through the best priced booking provider using HotelsCombined on the same check-in and check-out dates with the same booking conditions. The lower rate must be in the same currency. HotelsCombined will only refund the difference between the rate found on the lowest priced booking provider that participates with HotelsCombined and the lower rate if your reservation through the HotelsCombined participating provider is completed and not cancelled and not subject of a no-show. "Best Price Guarantee" does not apply to hotel rooms purchased through or in combination with membership rates, frequent stay, loyalty points or other "reward" type programs or special promotions of the hotel where the booking is made. Lower rates available through opaque sites where the exact hotel isn't known until after booking are also excluded from the guarantee. If your claim is successful the “Price Difference Refund” will be issued within 30 days after the check-out date of your reservation with the best priced booking provider listed on HotelsCombined.
