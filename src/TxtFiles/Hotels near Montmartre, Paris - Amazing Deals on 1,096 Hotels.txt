It’s the highest point in Paris and is home to the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur, which is nestled atop its summit. Montmartre is also a great spot for relaxing on the grassy slopes of Square Louise Michel park. Montmartre has inspired numerous artists over the years thanks to its sweeping city views, old-world Parisian streets and charming alfresco restaurants. You’ll find many of these restaurants near the top of the hill, including The Hardware Société Paris, which is known for its sumptuous breakfast. While you’re exploring Montmartre, visit the Musée de Montmartre to admire a collection of beautiful paintings in a 17th-century house where Renoir once worked. You can also see many of Salvador Dali's Surrealist paintings in the nearby Dalí Paris museum. Getting there Montmartre is best reached by catching the subway to the Anvers, Château Rouge or Abbesses stations and walking up the hill. It’s about 40 minutes’ drive from Charles de Gaulle Airport.
