Breakfast mainly generic asian food. Shower a bit awkward (hand held) Tv didnt work. Goof for the price. 2 train stops to Asoke BTS ~ takes 20 mins D 5.0 Passable Darren, Dec. 2016 Even though my room was upgraded it was still well below expectation. Only stayed here overnight because of the convenience of catching the train to the airport the next morning. In fact the train to the airport ran straight past my window even though I was on the 7th floor. The room decor was dark and outdated and beyond the need of a good clean. Once in the room I found dirty towels still in the bath and an opened bottle of drinking water. The two bottles of water that you would normally expect to be complimentary were in fact 0.25 BHT each. M 10.0 Excellent MD. Motlabur Rahman, Nov. 2016 thanks for the booking this hotel, I will fell so happy in staying this hotel , it's a grate place for easily movement at any where at move to bangkok, it's hospitality is very excrlant for my ends and next time when i visit to Bangkok I will agin stay this hotel as booking from your ends. Thanks for the quaparation.
