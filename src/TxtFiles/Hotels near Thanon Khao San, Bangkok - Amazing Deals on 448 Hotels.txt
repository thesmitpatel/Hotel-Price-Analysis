The pedestrian-only road is sealed off from traffic so market stalls can overflow with clothing, trinkets, tropical fruits and ready-to-eat Thai snacks. Mingle with travellers from around the globe as you wander down the one-kilometre-long street, which spills over into the adjacent Soi Rambuttri. There are plenty of bookshops, as well as massage parlours if you need some pampering. Feeling peckish? Khao San Road offers everything from traditional Thai to pizza parlours and falafel joints. Come nightfall, the street comes alive with a variety of bars, from hidden pubs to rooftop clubs where you can soak up Bangkok views. Getting around Thanon Khao San Khao San Road is easily accessed by bus and is around 20 minutes by taxi from the Siam or National Stadium BTS stations. The Panfa Leelard Pier is a 15-minute walk from the street and offers boat taxi services, while Suvarnabhumi International Airport is around 35 minutes’ drive away.
