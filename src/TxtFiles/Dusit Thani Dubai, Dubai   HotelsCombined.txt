They damaged my passport with some spilled ink. The room 716 is facing a main street and meteor train, like living in the middle of the street. The furniture and carpet are old and damaged. The main bedroom have a glass door with the bathe room so I cannot sleep when the sun is out. The air-conditioning is bad and could not be fix. The bathroom have a brooking toilet seat and the shower keep osculating hot and cold water. The elevators need maintenance. The parking building have very narrow spaces. They charge for everything, even printing some papers. Everything else is average.
