This wrought-iron lattice tower, built in the 19th century, overlooks the grassy Champ de Mars and stands at 324 metres tall. It’s Paris’ most iconic attraction, featuring sky-high restaurants, observation deck and surrounding souvenir stalls. To truly experience the Eiffel Tower, you need to make your way to the top using the elevators and stairs. Stop off at the first floor to step out onto the transparent floor a vertigo-inducing view of the people below. From here, continue up to the second floor for uninterrupted views of the Louvre, Grand Palais, Notre Dame and the Seine. The second floor also features the Michelin-starred Jules Verne, which serves gourmet French fare, as well as shops and a macaroon bar. Ride the glass-walled elevator to The Top, where you’ll stand 276 metres above the city. This level also has a champagne bar and an outdoor floor for city views. Getting there The Eiffel Tower is best reached by catching the subway to the Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel station and walking about 550 metres. You can also walk there in about 20 minutes from the Invalides train station.
