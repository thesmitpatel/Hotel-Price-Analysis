I only stayed one night on a stop over but if I had more time in bangkok Id have stayed longer. The food is great and at a good price and the staff were very helpful. Only hiccup was when I arrived I was told there were only twin rooms left, but once I said I prefered a double room as had been booked the staff found one. Easy access to the train line is also very convenient!
