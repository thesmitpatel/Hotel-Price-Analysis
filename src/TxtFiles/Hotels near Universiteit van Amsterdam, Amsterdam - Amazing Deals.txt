It is one of the largest research universities in Europe with more than 30,000 students and has produced not only six Nobel laureates, but also five Dutch prime ministers. The University of Amsterdam is organised into seven faculties, including Humanities, Social and Behavioural Sciences, Economics and Business, Science, Law, Medicine and Dentistry, which offer more than 50 Bachelor's programs and around 130 Master's programs. The main campus houses most of the faculties, set within buildings dating from as early as the 15th century and in a range of architectural styles that include Dutch Renaissance, Dutch Baroque, Art Deco, Amsterdam School and International style. Five of its buildings are designated as national monuments, including the Agnietenkapel monastery chapel and Agnes Gate which has become a symbol of the university. Dating back to 1606, the Oost-Indisch Huis served as the former headquarters of the Dutch East India Company, while the Oudemanhuispoort which houses the Faculty of Law was built in 1602 as a retirement home. To the east of the city is the newly built Science Park where the Faculty of Science and University Sports Centre are located, while the Faculty of Medicine is housed in the Academic Medical Centre in the Bijlmermeer neighbourhood to the south. A fourth campus is found at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam to the south of the city centre in the Zuidas district. The University of Amsterdam also operates five museums across the city covering everything from ancient antiquities to the history of computers. The city campus is easily reached along Amsterdam’s extensive tram system and within walking distance from the historic centre, while Science Park is served by its own train station. The Holendrecht train and metro station serve the Academic Medical Centre in Bijlmermeer while the Dentistry school is reached from the De Boelelaan/VU station in Zuidas. The University of Amsterdam has its roots in the Athenaeum Illustre which was founded in 1632 and focused on the early education of medical students. In 1877 it received the right to grant doctoral degrees and became the Municipal University of Amsterdam, flourishing with the addition of new faculties across a broad range of fields.
