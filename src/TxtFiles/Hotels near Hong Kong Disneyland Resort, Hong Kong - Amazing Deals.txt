While remaining true to its roots in Disney fantasy, it also adds a dash of culture, such as incorporating a traditional Chinese restaurant into the iconic Main Street USA. Seven themed areas ensure a full day of fun and adventure. The most iconic and classic Disney themes are still favourites in Hong Kong, including Madhatter Teacups, It’s a Small World, the Jungle River Cruise and Tarzan’s Treehouse. Visitors are bound to run across characters and recreations from Star Wars, Iron Man and Buzz Lightyear, and can join Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and their fuzzy friends at Mickey's PhilharMagic show. Fireworks electrify the skies nightly in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle, and the traditional fantasy parade turns Main Street into a dream come true for young and old alike. Hong Kong's public transit system links directly to Disneyland via train from both Hong Kong International Airport and the city centre, and by public bus, taxi, coach or car from most districts. A water taxi runs twice per day to the Disneyland Resort pier, adding another thrilling level to a magical day. A free shuttle bus takes Disney hotel guests to and from the theme park. Hong Kong Disneyland spans 1.3 square kilometres, effectively making it the island’s main attraction. In fact, the park was built in Penny’s Bay on land reclaimed specifically for Disney. In addition to the theme park and Disney-based hotels, Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre is perfect for some relaxing down time, with a woodsy park for picnics, and pedal boat and surrey bike rentals.
